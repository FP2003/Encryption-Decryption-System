Commands to use:

java Server 12345
java Client localhost 12345 alice

12345 is port, can be changed to anything I guess.


File RSA.java i believe is what we need to use next as it has the code to encrypt a message written

To do:
- check if hes done the 16 bytes differently or how hes done them in labs,
- What data is used to create the signiture
- How this client to server connection properly works
