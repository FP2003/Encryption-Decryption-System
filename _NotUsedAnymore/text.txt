Commands to use:

java Server 12345
java Client localhost 12345 alice

12345 is port, can be changed to anything I guess.


File RSA.java i believe is what we need to use next as it has the code to encrypt a message written

To do:
- check if hes done the 16 bytes differently or how hes done them in labs,
- What data is used to create the signiture
- How this client to server connection properly works

# Regarding - Bytes (Lab 1 (Bytes.java))
Snippet:
`byte[] data = new byte[8];`
So it is made relatively the same compared to our one:
`byte[] randomBytes = new byte[16];`

# Regarding - Signature
The client encrypts the userid + 16 random bytes using the server's public key (Server.pub) with the RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding algorithm.
The encrypted data is then signed using the client's private key (<userid>.prv) with the SHA1withRSA signature algorithm.

# Regarding - The client-to-server connection.
The client sends encrypted data and a signature to the server.
The server decrypts the data, verifies the signature, and authenticates the client.
The server responds with its own encrypted data and signature.
The client verifies the server's identity and validates the random bytes.
Both parties generate a shared AES key for secure communication.
